# MERN-DevConnect

This is an app which I have designed to strengthen my knowledge of the (M)ern, (E)xpress, (R)eact, (N)ode stack. This application is basically a social network 
for developers. Non-authenticated users can view profiles of all the developers who have registered with this app. In the profile section, apart from
usual details, users can also see the recent repositories of Github of the developer.This i have achieved with the help of te Github api.
If an user signs up as a developer, they have the option to create a profile, input their social media links, and attach their github profile with their account.
This will make all their repositories accessible from the dashboard of this app. Devs can also edit their profile, update their education and experience details. They can also post something, which will be visible to all the other developers in the network.
This works the same way as facebook posts, or twitter tweets. Other developers have the option to like, dislike or even commment on the posts. The state of the app is stored via Redux. All these details are stored in the MongoDB databse, so it is accessible to
the user who had created the post.
